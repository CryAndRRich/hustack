## Description
You are given two integers $m$ and $n$ representing the number of rows and columns of a grid, respectively. The cost to enter cell $(i, j)$ is defined as $(i + 1) * (j + 1)$. The path will always begin by entering cell $(0, 0)$ on move $1$ and paying the entrance cost.

At each step, you move to an adjacent cell, following an alternating pattern:
- On odd-numbered moves, you must move either right or down.
- On even-numbered moves, you must move either left or up.

Return the minimum total cost required to reach $(m - 1, n - 1)$. If it is impossible, return $-1$.

## Example
### Example 1:
**Input**: $m = 1, n = 1$  
**Output**: $1$  
**Explanation**: You start at cell $(0, 0)$. The cost to enter $(0, 0)$ is $(0 + 1) * (0 + 1) = 1$. Since you're at the destination, the total cost is $1$.

### Example 2:
**Input**: $m = 2, n = 1$  
**Output**: $3$  
**Explanation**: You start at cell $(0, 0)$ with cost $(0 + 1) * (0 + 1) = 1$. Move $1$ (odd): You can move down to $(1, 0)$ with cost $(1 + 1) * (0 + 1) = 2$. Thus, the total cost is $1 + 2 = 3$.
 
## Constraints:
- $1 \leq m, n \leq 10^6$
