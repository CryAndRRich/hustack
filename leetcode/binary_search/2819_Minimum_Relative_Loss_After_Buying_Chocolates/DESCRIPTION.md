## Description
You are given an integer array $prices$, which shows the chocolate prices and a $2D$ integer array queries, where $queries[i] = [k_i, m_i]$.

Alice and Bob went to buy some chocolates, and Alice suggested a way to pay for them, and Bob agreed.

The terms for each query are as follows:
- If the price of a chocolate is less than or equal to $k_i$, Bob pays for it.
- Otherwise, Bob pays $k_i$ of it, and Alice pays the rest.

Bob wants to select exactly $m_i$ chocolates such that his relative loss is minimized, more formally, if, in total, Alice has paid a_i and Bob has paid b_i, Bob wants to minimize $b_i - a_i$.

Return an integer array ans where $ans[i]$ is Bob's minimum relative loss possible for $queries[i]$.

## Example
### Example 1:
**Input**: $prices = [1,9,22,10,19], queries = [[18,4],[5,2]]$  
**Output**: $[34,-21]$  
**Explanation**: 
- For the $1^{st}$ query Bob selects the chocolates with prices $[1,9,10,22]$. He pays $1 + 9 + 10 + 18 = 38$ and Alice pays $0 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 4$. So Bob's relative loss is 38 - 4 = 34.
- For the $2^{nd}$ query Bob selects the chocolates with prices $[19,22]$. He pays $5 + 5 = 10$ and Alice pays $14 + 17 = 31$. So Bob's relative loss is $10 - 31 = -21$.

It can be shown that these are the minimum possible relative losses.

### Example 2:
**Input**: $prices = [1,5,4,3,7,11,9], queries = [[5,4],[5,7],[7,3],[4,5]]$  
**Output**: $[4,16,7,1]$  
**Explanation**: 
- For the $1^{st}$ query Bob selects the chocolates with prices $[1,3,9,11]$. He pays $1 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 14$ and Alice pays $0 + 0 + 4 + 6 = 10$. So Bob's relative loss is $14 - 10 = 4$.
- For the $2^{nd}$ query Bob has to select all the chocolates. He pays $1 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 28$ and Alice pays $0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 12$. So Bob's relative loss is $28 - 12 = 16$.
- For the $3^{rd}$ query Bob selects the chocolates with prices $[1,3,11]$ and he pays $1 + 3 + 7 = 11$ and Alice pays $0 + 0 + 4 = 4$. So Bob's relative loss is $11 - 4 = 7$.
- For the $4^{th}$ query Bob selects the chocolates with prices $[1,3,7,9,11]$ and he pays $1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16$ and Alice pays $0 + 0 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 15$. So Bob's relative loss is $16 - 15 = 1$.

It can be shown that these are the minimum possible relative losses.

### Example 3:
**Input**: $prices = [5,6,7], queries = [[10,1],[5,3],[3,3]]$  
**Output**: $[5,12,0]$  
**Explanation**: 
- For the $1^{st}$ query Bob selects the chocolate with price $5$ and he pays $5$ and Alice pays $0$. So Bob's relative loss is $5 - 0 = 5$.
- For the $2^{nd}$ query Bob has to select all the chocolates. He pays $5 + 5 + 5 = 15$ and Alice pays $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$. So Bob's relative loss is $15 - 3 = 12$.
- For the $3^{rd}$ query Bob has to select all the chocolates. He pays $3 + 3 + 3 = 9$ and Alice pays $2 + 3 + 4 = 9$. So Bob's relative loss is $9 - 9 = 0$.

It can be shown that these are the minimum possible relative losses.
